<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"><b>About me</b></h2>

<p>As a Data Scientist with over 4 years of industry and research experience, I'm passionate about applying my expertise to solve real-world complex challenges. Currently, I'm leading a research project analyzing narrative shifts, user engagement, and information warfare tactics on Telegram during the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This project, a collaboration with esteemed professors including <a href="https://www.ugurkursuncu.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Ugur Kursuncu</a> (Georgia State University), <a href="https://www.umassd.edu/directory/dachilov/" target="_blank">Dr. Dilshod Achilov</a> (UMass Dartmouth), and <a href="https://people.wright.edu/valerie.shalin" target="_blank">Dr. Valerie L. Shalin</a> (Wright State University), is targeted for publication in <a href="https://www.nature.com/ncomms/" target="_blank">Nature Communications</a> by March 2024 (check details <a href="https://southnlp.github.io/southnlp2024/papers/southnlp2024-poster-39.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>).</p> Before that, I worked on <a href="https://www.mlecofi.net/home" target="_blank">MLEcoFi project</a> (A Machine Learning Ecosystem for Filament Detection), collaborated with <a href="https://www.azim-a.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Azim Ahmadzadeh</a> from the University of Missouri-St. Louis. My contributions included developing a wavelet filter compression algorithm to optimize the size of astronomical images, facilitating more efficient filament-detection processes (check details <a href="https://cpaess.ucar.edu/sites/default/files/meetings/abstracts/sww-2023/posters/McDonald-Samuel.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>).


<p>I'm pursuing my masters in Data Science and Analytics with a concentration in Big Data and Machine Learning at <a href="https://www.gsu.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia State University</a>, anticipating graduation in May 2024 with a 4.0 GPA (details <a href="https://bawa-apaar.github.io/Courses/" target="_blank">here</a>), all while funded by a prestigious full tuition waiver scholarship. Prior to this, I have worked with <a href="https://www.tcs.com/" target="_blank">Tata Consultancy Services</a> for 3+ years, building end-to-end applications with machine learning models, data pipelines, APIs, and production deployments. Further, I was a Data Science intern at <a href="https://www.truist.com/" target="_blank">Truist Financial Bank</a> (Atlanta, USA) and <a href="https://www.airtel.in/bank/" target="_blank">Airtel Payments Bank</a> (Gurugram, India), respectively.</p>
