<h2>About me:</h2>

<p>As a Data Scientist with over 4 years of industry and research experience, I'm passionate about applying my expertise to solve real-world complex challenges. Currently, I'm leading a research project analyzing narrative shifts, user engagement, and information warfare tactics on Telegram during the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This project, a collaboration with esteemed professors including <a href="https://www.ugurkursuncu.com/">Dr. Ugur Kursuncu</a> (Georgia State University), <a href="https://www.umassd.edu/directory/dachilov/">Dr. Dilshod Achilov</a> (UMass Dartmouth), and <a href="https://people.wright.edu/valerie.shalin">Dr. Valerie L. Shalin</a> (Wright State University), is targeted for publication in <a href="https://www.nature.com/ncomms/">Nature Communications</a> by March 2024. Explore further details about our project <a href="https://southnlp.github.io/southnlp2024/papers/southnlp2024-poster-39.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>I am currently a master's student in Data Science and Analytics with a concentration in Big Data and Machine Learning at <a href="https://www.gsu.edu/">Georgia State University</a>, anticipating graduation in May 2024 with a 4.0 GPA (details <a href="https://bawa-apaar.github.io/Courses/">here</a>), all while funded by a prestigious full tuition waiver scholarship. Prior to this, I have worked with Tata Consultancy Services (Transportation domain) for 3+ years, building end-to-end applications with machine learning models, data pipelines, APIs, and production deployments. Further, I was a Data Science intern at <a href="https://www.truist.com/">Truist Financial Bank</a> (Atlanta, USA) and <a href="https://www.airtel.in/bank/">Airtel Payments Bank</a> (Gurugram, India), respectively.</p>



<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"><b>Interests</b></h2>
I have broad interests in <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9357868">knowledge</a> graphs and machine learning (in particular deep learning) for application into natural language processing, recommender systems, and computational social data science. My research is mostly directed towards:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8970629">Knowledge-infused Learning</a>: is a class of Neuro-Symbolic AI techniques that utilize a variety of knowledge (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3269206.3271732">lexical</a>, linguistic, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0250448">domain specific</a>, <a href="https://www.aaai.org/AAAI22Papers/AAAI-10689.GaurM.pdf">commonsense</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.13884.pdf"> process knowledge</a> and constraint-based) in different forms and abstractions into <a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2600/paper14.pdf">deep neural network</a>. It improves upon data-centric statistical learning to reduce training, reduce computing needs, and broaden coverage, resulting in improved performance, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.12560.pdf">safety</a> and model interpretation, and providing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpuhqjKNnDg&t=3352s">user-level explanations</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9514440">Knowledge Intensive Language Understanding:</a>  is a new unified benchmark to help AI researchers build models that are better able to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08145">leverage real-world knowledge</a> to accomplish a broad range of tasks. Models that are better able to leverage real-world knowledge do well in tasks o</li>
</ul>
I recently gave a tutorial on <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/aiisc/finalkgckirltutorial2022aiinstitutepptx">Knowledge-infused Reinforcement Learning</a> at <a href="https://www.knowledgegraph.tech/kgc-2022-tutorial-knowledge-infused-reinforcement-learning/">Knowledge Graph Conference</a>, which is one of core AI areas I am interested in. I am fascinated about interdisciplinary research as it provide practical means to make real world impact. I collaborate with domain experts in mental health, crisis informatics, conversational AI, virtual health assistant, and digital security. I also have been a co-organizer and a strong proponent of two communities: <a href="https://aiisc.ai/KiL2021/">Knowledge-infused Mining and Learning</a> and <a href="https://clpsych.org/">Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology</a>.
